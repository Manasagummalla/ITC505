      <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Creative Choices and Process:</strong>
        In this version of the "Choose Your Adventure" game, the focus was on
        creating a thrilling and eerie experience. Each stage of the story is
        accompanied by atmospheric images that enhance the feeling of being in a
        haunted mansion. The design aims to immerse the player in a spooky
        narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong>
        A major challenge was creating a seamless narrative that maintains
        suspense throughout. By carefully planning the story structure and using
        evocative imagery, we achieved this. Ensuring the game is responsive on
        all devices was another challenge, which was addressed through flexible
        design and testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Insights and Learnings:</strong>
        This project emphasized the importance of atmosphere in storytelling.
        Visual and textual elements must work together to create an engaging
        experience. We also learned that providing clear and meaningful choices
        enhances player engagement and immersion.
