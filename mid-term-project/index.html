      <strong>Creative Choices and Process:</strong>
      In this version of the "Choose Your Adventure" game, the focus was on
      creating a thrilling and eerie experience. Each stage of the story is
      accompanied by atmospheric images that enhance the feeling of being in a
      haunted mansion. The design aims to immerse the player in a spooky
      narrative.

      <strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong>
      A major challenge was creating a seamless narrative that maintains
      suspense throughout. By carefully planning the story structure and using
      evocative imagery, we achieved this. Ensuring the game is responsive on
      all devices was another challenge, which was addressed through flexible
      design and testing.

      enhances player engagement and immersion.
