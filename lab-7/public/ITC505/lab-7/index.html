    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>This page was created as part of the ITC505 Lab 7 assignment. The goal was to implement a simple ExpressJS server and a Mad Lib form with at least five input fields. The form collects user input and generates a humorous story using the provided words.</p>
    <p>Here is the step-by-step process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Setup ExpressJS Server:</strong> The `server.js` file initializes an Express server, sets up middleware for URL-encoded data and logging, and serves static files from the `public` directory. It also includes a route to generate a random number.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Dependencies:</strong> We installed necessary packages: `express` for the server, `morgan` for improved logging, and `forever` for easier server management.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Public Directory:</strong> A `public` folder was created to hold the HTML and CSS files for the labs, ensuring they are served correctly by the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Mad Lib Form:</strong> The `index.html` file includes a form with five input fields: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and plural noun. This form posts data back to the same URL.</li>
        <li><strong>Handle Form Submission:</strong> In `server.js`, a POST route was added to handle form submissions. It takes the input from the form, constructs a Mad Lib story, and sends it back to the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Style the Form:</strong> A `style.css` file was created to improve the appearance of the form and make the page more user-friendly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps, the server and form were successfully set up, allowing users to create and view their Mad Lib stories dynamically.</p>
